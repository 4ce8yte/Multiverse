        <h3 class="text-primary mb-3"><a href="/species/void.html">Void Tribe</a></h3>
        <div class="px-4">
          <p>Void Multivars are the least trusted of the tribes, believed to be evil and hateful, largely because of their physical nature, being utterly black, devoid of color. In addition to this, Voids wear Skulls on their head like hats, adding to the general stigma of them being utterly evil. The glass on a Voids stomach and chest contains acid that is a transparent black in color that melts anything that it touches, other than the skin, glass and bones of the multivar it came from, while the glass growing on their legs, is filled with an unknown substance that litterally absorbs light, which is used to fuel their glowing eyes. However, when one gets to know a Void, they find them extremely sweet, and very protective when they find people who trust them and enjoy their company.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="text-primary mb-3"><a href="/species/light.html">Light Tribe</a></h3>
        <div class="px-4">
          <p>The Light Multivars, are viewed as the nicest, and most trusted by the other tribes, however, looks can be deceiving. These multivars, are often backed by the Galaxy and Star tribes, especially against the Void tribe. In coloration, they are practically the complete opposite of Voids in physical color, being bright pastel, and the acid and substance in the glass on their body are opaqe, and pastel in color. More often than not, the acid Glows faintly.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="text-primary mb-3"><a href="/species/galaxy.html">Galaxy Tribe</a></h3>
        <div class="px-4">
          <p>While not as tall as the Light or Void tribe, Galaxy Multivars have the greatest muscle mass, and tend to be bullies to the other tribes, when not backing the Light Tribe against the Voids. The liquids within the glass on their bodies are often multicolored, with rich swirls of color, and some Galaxy Multivars have visible planets and asteroids floating around in the liquid in their legs and in their horns (on rare occasion). Unlike the other tribes, some of this tribe can have multiple tails. These Multivars are made of extremely vast collecionts of space dust and gases.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="text-primary mb-3"><a href="/species/star.html">Star Tribe</a></h3>
        <div class="px-4">
          <p>The smallest of the tribes, Star Multivars are generally looked down upon, both physically and socially. However, when a Star Multivar is made a friend, they are found to be kind, and loving, and make up for their small stature tenfold in personality. The liquid and Acid of Stars are extremely bright neon in color, and these Multivars are largely made up of Helium, Nitrogen and a few other assorted gases.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="text-primary mb-3"><a href="/species/ara.html">Ara Tribe</a></h3>
        <div class="px-4">
          <p>With each new spring, from the wooded places of the Multiverse, comes a tribe of Multivars known as the Ara Tribe. Not a large amount is known of the Ara's. Perhaps with the strangest of coats, large portions of them are made of leaves, berry vines and flowers. The colors of the leaves change with the seasons, so the same Var could have green leaves in summer, and in fall have brown. The acid in their very long and slender bodies, seem almost to be made up of flower petals, while their horns often look plantlike, such as tree branches, bushes and such, and their antennae are similar, looking like anything from blades of grass to flowers. perhaps the most soft spoken of the tribes, Ara's are quiet and mysterious but are very majestic, kind and welcoming to all Vars, though, due to them only coming around during the springtime, which marks the end of the winter season, they are hated by the Snow and Noel tribes, and as such, the Ara's avoid them when possible. Normally, when Ara's are seen, they are often in large number, in herd like groups, which can be quite impressive, as they are slightly smaller than the average Void. Very social within their own tribe, they will often groom each other when resting.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="text-primary mb-3"><a href="/species/leto.html">Leto Tribe</a></h3>
        <div class="px-4">
          <p>In the deep waters of the known universes, exists a Tribe of Multivars known as the Leto Tribe. sleek in shape, Leto Vars have smooth, Fish like scales or sharklike skin that are often tropical colors or shades of blues and silver. Some Leto's that live in the great gas clouds of the universes have scales that bioluminesce to allow them to see. Streamlined for swimming quickly through space and with Fin like legs, Leto's give the sense of Mermaids. The Blue colored acid within the glass on their body goes all the way down their stomach, towards the tip of their tail, allowing for camouflage within the void. The acid can also hold sea life within, such as Seaweed and Seastars.  Their horns, often made out of Coral, though not always, gives them a proud look, befitting their Kind nature, often putting them in good terms with the Ara Tribe. Due to their gills, Leto Vars don't have Fur on their body to allow them to breathe easier, without worrying about clogging their gills. Letos are about twice as long as an Ara from fin to fluke, but are as tall as the average Light from finpoint to the tip of their horn. Leto's reside within the massive gas clouds produced by the deaths of stars and the supernovas left behind.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="text-primary mb-3"><a href="/species/noel.html">Noel Tribe</a></h3>
        <div class="px-4">
          <p>The Noel tribe is only seen once a year, during the last month, according to Multivar time standards. They are miniscule, smaller than the smallest star multivar to have ever lived, however they contain the kindest and happiest hearts in their tiny bodies. They often have bells and ribbons adorned on their body and many have pointy ears and sweet candy like growths appear on their bodies. The acid in their stomach glass is opaque and sparkly in color, always in either red, green, silver or gold, and the liquid in their legs glow one of those colors. A rare few Noel multivars will stay behind, while the rest of their tribe continues on to whatever place they come from, and so the occasional multivar may pop up with a winter flair.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="text-primary mb-3"><a href="/species/snow.html">Snow Tribe</a></h3>
        <div class="px-4">
          <p>Seen as rarely as the Noel, the Snow tribe only shows up once a year, in Multivar time standards. Between the size of Stars and Galaxies in size, Snows have the attitude and aggressiveness mistakenly and undeservingly given to the Void tribe. Their fur is the consistency and temperature of snow, and can come in many different colors, however the colors are always subdued, due to their life in the tundra and they have very small ears. Where the other tribes have liquid in the glass containers on their legs and stomachs, The Snow tribe have what are essentially snow globes, with ever constant flurries of snow in their legs and chest, in varying pale pastel colors. The Noel tribe, after spending much of their lives and generations in the frozen  tundra has turned these beings into Aggressive beasts, or that's how the Noels put it.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="text-primary mb-3"><a href="/species/god.html">Multivar Gods</h3>
        <div class="px-4">
          <p>Not much is known of the beings that the Multivars simply call Gods. believed to be similar in basic shape to Multivars, but larger by a hundredfold, and stronger than that by even more. while Tribe Leaders can each hold one universe with them, Gods are believed to be able to hold two, and possibly even three. One agreed upon trait is that some of the gods have upwards of two spinal columns protruding along their back, the visible white bone gleaming against their fur. The leaders of the four Tribes say that they were each given their power directly from the Gods, believing themselves to be appointed.</p>
